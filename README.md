# PythonBenchmarks
Benchmarks for the matrix multiplication (dot product) using numpy and sparse matrices

#### 1. Benchmark: 
####Comparing the Runtime of SciPy's seven implementations for sparse matrices
Hier the Matrix multiplication is done with two square matrices, which consist of 99% zeros. 
The runtime is measured as a function of the matrix size.
